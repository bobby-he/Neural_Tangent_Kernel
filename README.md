# Neural Tangent Kernel in PyTorch
Simulations and report based on the papers [Neural Tangent Kernel][1] by Jacot et al. and [Wide Neural Networks of Any Depth Evolve as Linear Models Under Gradient Descent][2] by Lee et al.  
  
Produced as part of ML module for OxWaSP CDT 1st year.

### Example from  ยง6.2 of [Jacot et al.][1]
